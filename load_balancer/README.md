# Load Balancer basic config

## Usage:
```
./main_script <web-01 ip> <web-02 ip> <path_to_pub_key> <load_balancer ip>
```

- Don't run any other script from here because they will run locally.
- This creates a folder in the home directory with some files, but after running it will be deleted.

This script won't break a working load balancer server
